# Prediction-model

We take the enlisted housing details of atmost 20,000 houses in the state of California. The dataset is from Kaggle and is attached in the form of csv here. 
We apply decision tree and random forest ML algorithms to predict the house value of any house situated in California by using some features in our dataset.
